# Face Recognition using Eigen Faces
This is a Face Recognition algorithm using a technique called Eigen Faces for face recognition built using research paper published by MA TURK and AP Pentland

## How To Use
To use this program first of all add your training images path to the "cd" and "dir" code in eigenAlgo.m file.
This project was test on images from Yale Face Database in which the size of all images was same so the size of your images must be same
